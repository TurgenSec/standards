We will be practising a mini version of [Git Flow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html).

The current version is to enhance developer velocity. Once we have proper customers and releases, we will move to the full GitFlow model.

## Developer GitFlow Guide

- All work by developers should happen in their own branch, which was created from master.
- For all completed work, raise a Pull Request(PR) to the master/main branch and tag your Github Team (eg: @TurgenSec/datashadow, @TurgenSec/saas, etc ) in the description. This ensures everyone in the team is aware of the discussions.
- Keep your PRs short. It's easier to review small chunks than a big fat PR with a thousand lines.
- All team members should go through Open PRs, review the code and give suggestions if any. You should make it a habit to review and comment on your own PR. After all, you know your code best and will catch any issues easier.
- You should NEVER merge your own PR. It will be merged after all comments are resolved.
- Always resolve all comments in a PR.

## Commit Messages

- Follow https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ when possible
- Avoid non descriptive messages like 'Update', 'Test', etc.

## Releases

- master/main will be the Branch being released to Production.
