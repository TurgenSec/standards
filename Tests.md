# Testing

Have basic tests which ensure your project will run properly if the tests pass.
This is integral to the CI/CD pipeline as we will be notified if something breaks before pushed to production.

Do not write too many tests just for the sake of it, as a startup, our requirements will be dynamic so a lot of tests will make progress slow.

Make use of Snapshot Tests where possible, makes writing tests easy.

# Testing Setup

The pypi link below provides code examples for how to set up snapshot testing;
