# Coding Standards

Overview: https://www.browserstack.com/guide/coding-standards-best-practices

## Key Points

- Keep it Readable and Testable
- Always use Types
- KISS: Keep Is Simple Stupid.
- WET: Write Everything Twice. Dupliacte code two times, If you need it a third time, abstract it to a function or optimise it.
- YAGNI: You Aren't Gonna Need It. Don't spend too much time planning of how things will be needed in the future. If you are writing good, modularised code, extending it should be simple.
- Space/Tabs/Formatting: Let the autoFormatter do it.
